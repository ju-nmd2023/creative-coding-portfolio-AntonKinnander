// P5.js recreation of the Anne by Georg Nees

// Looking at the original it looks like there are lines beginning at the edges of the canvas and extending towards origo (0,0)
// Also the line density increases as they get closer to the 0 coordinate of their axis, which creates a 3d effect

// Basically im thinking i could just create lines along the edges of the canvas, going towards origo, the dark shape in the middle should still appear because close to 0 x or y there will be a huge amount of lines crammed into the space.

// Idea, have clicking reveal an eye in the middle (blinking) with a mitten av Ã¶gat that follows the mouse

    push();
    // easier for me to understand since the center is the center (origo)
    translate(width / 2, height / 2);
  
    // draw rows of lines along edges - Top + bottom = x value controlled coords 0,height/2 - 0,-height/2. Vice versa for sides. One node of lines is always origo
    let numLines = 30; 
  
    // Draw lines, pow for density increase as they get closer to origo ( I was trying to make it work with absolute values and division but after consulting chatgpt i realized pow was easier)
    for (let i = 0; i <= numLines; i++) {
   
      let t = map(i, 0, numLines, -1, 1);
      let density = pow(t, 3);
