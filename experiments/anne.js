// P5.js recreation of the Anne by Georg Nees

// Looking at the original it looks like there are lines beginning at the edges of the canvas and extending towards origo (0,0)
// Also the line density increases as they get closer to the 0 coordinate of their axis, which creates a 3d effect

// Basically im thinking i could just create lines along the edges of the canvas, going towards origo, the dark shape in the middle should still appear because close to 0 x or y there will be a huge amount of lines crammed into the space.

// Idea, have clicking reveal an eye in the middle (blinking) with a mitten av Ã¶gat that follows the mouse
